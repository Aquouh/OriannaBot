/**
 * The updater is responsible for "updating" user ranks every set interval.
 * This updater actually runs 3 different updating loops, each at different intervals.
 * From ran most often to ran least often:
 * - Update Mastery Scores (level, score)
 * - Update Ranked Information (amount of games, ranked tier)
 * - Update Summoners (check if the summoner was renamed, transferred)
 * These different intervals are mostly because of the rate limits imposed on us by
 * the Riot API. Do note that a manual refresh will do all of these at the same time.
 *
 * Terminology used:
 * - fetch: pulling (new) data from the riot API and writing it to a User instance.
 *          this will **not** recalculate roles in discord.
 * - update: calculate new roles for a user based on their current User instance.
 *           this should be ran when either the role conditions change or the user
 *           was previously fetched (and thus might have new data)
